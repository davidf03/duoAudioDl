# Todo

## General
[ ] develop styles

## Background
[ ] generalise implementation of lng adding to avoid false positives for target language in case translation audio is provided too

## Store

## Nav
[ ] figure out correct html for language selector, given potential for nice transitions here vs interoperability of generic parts with other contexts, e.g. deck selection on History and defaults selections on Settings
- consider making language selector a wrapper containing special toggle, around a collapsed select-like radio set

## Queue
[ ] card fields dynamically after template

[ ] card ignore

[ ] card create

[ ] make default template pref each language prefer last template used before template at first index

## Settings
[ ] clear history

[ ] clear ignored

## History
[ ] card history after queue

[ ] choose deck after language

[ ] Anki connection status indicator, potentially with option to reload (idk why, but might be nice)

[ ] Variable notifications (e.g. connecting -> connected)
